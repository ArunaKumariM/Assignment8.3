# Assignment 8.3

# A Recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% ofcollege
#  students have used Wikipédia as a source in at least one of their term paper
#  Let X be equal the number of students in a random sample of size n 3l who have
#  used Wikipedia as a source.
# Perform the below operations:
  
# A. Find the probability that X is equal to 17

# x =   Value
# p = 1/3
# n = 31

pbinom(17,31,1/3)

# B. Find the probability that X is at most l3

pbinom(13,31,1/3)

# C. Find the probability that X is bigger than 11

##pbinom(X>=11,n,p) = 1 - p(X<=11,n,p)
1- pbinom(11,31,1/3)

# D. Find the probability that X is atleast 15
##pbinom(X>=15,n,p) = 1 - p(X<=15,n,p)
1- pbinom(15,31,1/3)



# E. Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19, inclusive
##pbinom(X>=16,n,p)  +  p(X<=19,n,p)
## 1 - pbinom(X<=16,n,p)  +  p(X<=19,n,p)
1- pbinom(16,31,1/3)+pbinom(19,31,1/3)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
##summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
